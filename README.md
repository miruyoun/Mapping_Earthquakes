# Mapping Earthquakes

## Brief Overview
The objective of this project was to create an interactive map that users can use to see earthquakes around the world. The map has different three different views and three different overlays. Three views are available, including street, satellite, and outdoor mode, while the overlay contains information on earthquakes worldwide, tectonic plates, and major earthquakes. The map depicts earthquakes in various sizes and colors. Stronger earthquakes will have a larger radius and darker color than weaker ones, which will have a smaller radius and lighter color. The purpose of this map is primarily to illustrate earthquake data as they relate to tectonic plate positioning.
